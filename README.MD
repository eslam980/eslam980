  <summary>ðŸ“‚ More Information</summary>
  I'm a Game Developer and Software Engineer, I like creating different types of games but usually I really like creating Real-Time Strategy, TPS, Top-Down, and Roguelike games. 
  Beyond game engines, I am proficient in coding across multiple languages, I also enjoy creating software apps and tools that enhance productivity and my workflow.
  
  In my role as a Software Developer, I usually focus on the back-end side of software development but that doesn't mean that I don't make beautiful and elegant design using multiple frameworks "usually web-based frameworks like react or flutter-likes".
